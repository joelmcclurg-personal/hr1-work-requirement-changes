# Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create new repository:
   - **Owner:** joelmcclurg-personal
   - **Repository name:** hr1-snap-work-requirements
   - **Description:** Visual explainer showing SNAP work requirement changes under HR1 (OBBBA)
   - **Visibility:** Public
   - **DO NOT initialize with README** (we already have one)
3. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

The repository is already configured with the remote. Just push:

```bash
cd ~/hr1-snap-work-requirements
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repository settings: https://github.com/joelmcclurg-personal/hr1-snap-work-requirements/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** main
   - **Folder:** / (root)
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
5. GitHub will show: "Your site is live at https://joelmcclurg-personal.github.io/hr1-snap-work-requirements/"

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. Visit: https://joelmcclurg-personal.github.io/hr1-snap-work-requirements/
2. Check that:
   - [ ] Page loads without errors
   - [ ] All three cards expand/collapse
   - [ ] "Am I Affected?" quiz opens
   - [ ] Age calculator works
   - [ ] Children's age calculator works
   - [ ] All visualizations render
   - [ ] Links open correctly
   - [ ] Responsive on mobile (test in browser dev tools)

## Step 5: Test on Actual Devices

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] iPhone Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)
- [ ] Test card interactions (tap to expand)
- [ ] Test quiz flow
- [ ] Test calculators with keyboard

### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab through all interactive elements)
- [ ] Screen reader (VoiceOver on Mac, NVDA on Windows)
- [ ] High contrast mode
- [ ] Zoom to 200%

## Step 6: Embedding in Substack (Optional)

To embed in a Substack post:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://joelmcclurg-personal.github.io/hr1-snap-work-requirements/"
  width="100%"
  height="2400"
  frameborder="0"
  style="border: none; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
  title="HR1 SNAP Work Requirements Visual Explainer">
</iframe>
```

**Test the embed:**
- [ ] Verify scrolling works inside iframe
- [ ] Check that cards expand without breaking layout
- [ ] Test quiz opens and closes properly
- [ ] Verify external links work from iframe

## Troubleshooting

### Page doesn't load on GitHub Pages
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in settings
- Verify the branch is set to `main` and folder is `/` (root)
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
- Verify all file paths are relative (no leading `/`)

### Data doesn't load
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for fetch errors
- Check that `data/requirements.json` exists and is valid JSON
- Verify CORS is not blocking (shouldn't be an issue with same origin)

### Visualizations don't render
- Check that D3.js CDN is loading: https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js
- Open browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify containers exist: `#age-viz`, `#parent-viz`, `#exemptions-viz`, `#timeline-viz`

### Quiz doesn't work
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify modal HTML exists in index.html
- Test modal open/close buttons

## Making Updates

When you need to update the site:

1. Edit files locally
2. Test changes: `python3 -m http.server 8001`
3. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
4. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
5. Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
6. Verify changes live

## Performance Notes

- Page should load in under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- D3.js is loaded from CDN (cached by browser)
- All images are SVG (inline or generated by D3)
- No external dependencies except D3.js
