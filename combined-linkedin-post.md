# LinkedIn Post: Two SNAP Policy Tools, Zero Lines of Code

---

I'm not a developer. I work in food security advocacy. But over the past few months, I built two interactive policy tools that I think demonstrate something important about where advocacy is heading.

**The first:** an interactive scrollytelling map showing 18 states implementing SNAP purchase restrictions, each with different definitions of what's restricted. Iowa bases restrictions on their tax code. Arkansas created five categories. Nebraska restricts "soft drinks," Texas restricts "sweetened drinks" — and those aren't synonyms. I built it in under an hour using Claude Code and USDA public data.

**The second:** an interactive explainer breaking down the three major SNAP work requirement changes in H.R. 1 — the age expansion from 54 to 64, the parent exemption narrowed from children under 18 to under 14, and exemptions removed for veterans, people experiencing homelessness, and foster youth aging out. This one has built-in calculators so someone can check if the changes affect them, and shareable cards so a caseworker can send a client just the part that's relevant to their situation.

Neither of these required me to learn JavaScript or D3.js. I described what I wanted — conversationally, in plain language — and iterated from there.

**Here's what building both taught me:** This isn't a party trick. It's a pattern. Domain experts who understand policy, who know what questions real people are asking, can now build communication tools at the speed policy changes happen. When H.R. 1 was signed July 4th and states have 10 months to implement, you can't wait for an RFP cycle to produce something useful.

**For advocates:** Your competitive advantage was always domain expertise. The difference now is that the technical barrier between your knowledge and a working tool has largely collapsed. You don't need to learn to code. You need to know what to build.

**For the tech and AI community:** This is what applied AI looks like in practice — not chatbots or content generation, but messy real-world policy made navigable for the people it affects.

I'll be presenting on AI tools for benefits navigation at the FRAC conference in April. If you're working on benefits access, food security, or civic technology, I'd love to connect.

**FIRST COMMENT:**

Explore the interactive tools:

Both built with Claude Code from public data sources (USDA FNS, H.R. 1 text, Census data).
